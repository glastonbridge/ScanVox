About
=====

ScanVox records brief clips of your voice, and turns them into musical synths.
It analyses the pitch, loudness and timbre of vocal sound, and uses that 
information to control a selection of synths.

The "timbre remapping" technology is taken from Dan Stowell's PhD research.
For technical details see his thesis: http://www.mcld.co.uk/thesis/

The audio infrastructure used is SuperCollider-Android:
